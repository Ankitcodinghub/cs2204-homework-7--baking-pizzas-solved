Objectives

Understand Python generators

Build a supply chain model

Work with physical time

Eat more pizzas

Background

In this assignment, you are building a supply chain model for PizzaPy, Co. using Python generators. Each ingredient and the intermediate workflow steps will be implemented as generator functions. The goal of this exercise is to have a better understanding of how iteration works in Python and how iterators pull data from each other on-demand. The ingredients and intermediate products are measured in simple (fictional) quantities. E.g., a pizza dough will need one flour, one yeast, one salt_, and one _water.

Tasks

change/add/delete any testing code. The outputs of this testing code are not going to be graded. The validator program will use your code directly.

1. Implement the flour_sack generator function. This should be a relatively simple exercise. This generator should produce a finite amount of ‚Äúflour‚Äù strings. The number of generated strings is provided as a parameter for the generator function. The expected behavior of this function is this:

for flour in flour_sack(5): print(flour)

This should print the following:

flour flour flour flour flour

2. Implement the yeast_jar , salt_shaker , sauce_container generator functions. These are all the same as the previous one, except for the generated strings (see the source code documentation strings for details). Don‚Äôt feel bad by using copy &amp; paste this time.

3. Implement the water_faucet generator function. This is even simplier because we have an unlimited supply of water resources (this pizza chain is not in California).

5. Implement the cheese_grater generator function. Living in an ideal world, we also have unlimited cheese. However, there is a throughput limit on how fast we can make shredded cheese. The throughput parameter of this function tells you how many ‚Äúcheese‚Äù strings you are allowed to generate in a single second. Initially, you can produce up-to throughput number of elements, but after that, you should generate a new element if in the past 1.0 second less then throughput number were produced. If this is not the case, you should wait ( sleep ) in this generator to maintain the rate. Hint: you definitely want to use the

time.time() and time.sleep() functions, and you also need to keep track of the

producing times of the ‚Äúcheese‚Äù items at least for the last second (e.g., in a list). Note: this is the hardest part of the assignment. You will be given (generous) partial credit if you cannot solve the rate control problem.

6. Implement the pizza_preparator generator function, which is very similar to dough_maker , but requires a dough , a sauce , and a cheese iterator and should

produce ‚Äúraw_pizza‚Äù strings. Also, because we have an unlimited amount of cheese (albeit at a limited rate), the pizza preparator should use 5 cheese elements for each raw pizza. Yum.

7. Finally, implement the oven generator function, which consumes raw_pizza items and generates ‚Äúpizza‚Äù strings. There is a single parameter for this function ( baking_time ). The generator should wait for this amount of seconds before producing a pizza from a raw pizza. Again, you should use the time.sleep() function, but the code should be much simpler than for cheese_grater .

Hints

If you decide to use the next() function inside one of your generators (you don‚Äôt need to do so to solve the assignment), there is an important caveat. If you are already in a generator, you cannot simply rely on the fact that the next() function call on another iterator will generate a

StopIteration by itself, and it would be automatically propagated from your generator, too (a detailed, but probably too technical explanation can be found here

(https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479/)). So, either avoid using next() , or use it with the following way (try/except block) inside a generator:

def example_generator(another_iterator): while True: try:

item = next(another_iterator) except StopIteration: return

This code transforms a StopIteration exception to a simple return from your generator, ending the iteration.

from itertools import islice for item in islice(range(30), 6, None, 7): print(item)

this should print

6

13

20

27

The meaning of islice(range(30), 6, None, 7) is that you want to take every 7th element from range(30) starting at index 6 . It is important to always get the last element ( 6 ) of each seven-element segment to make sure you won‚Äôt use a partial segment at the end.

Grading

Penalties

Points will be deducted if you fail to set __author__ variable (-10 pts) and for each PEP 8 style errors (-1 pt for each) in your program.
